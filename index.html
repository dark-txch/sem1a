        <p>
          Hello Friend, <br />I am <span>Ebenezer Tiewei</span> and a student of
          <span>AltSchool Africa,</span> <br />
          my id number is
          <span>ALT/SOE/024/030</span> and I am currently studying
          <span>frontend engineering.</span>
        </p>
        <p>I am born and raised in Nigeria and i speak 2 languages fluently.</p>
        <p>
          my professional interest was to be a medical doctor until i realised
          that i can't stand needles, so i decided to go into <br />the fitness
          sector because i love fitness and i have been in the fitness sector
          ever since <br />
          and now it''s time for a change in career.
        </p>

        <p><span>My hobbies are:</span></p>
        <ul class="ul-li">
          <li>going to the gym</li>
          <li>playing football</li>
          <li>reading</li>
          <li>listening to music</li>
          <li>watching documentaries and movie series</li>
          <li>newest addition is <em>coding</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I am a newbie to the tech sector and i just started my transition
          journey from the fitness sector to the tech sector, <br />
          and i am excited about this journey and so far it as been interesting
          and challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
          I picked an interest to tech after watching a video on youtube, <br />
          i did a few research and started to train myself but i got bored along
          the way and stopped until i came across <br />
          <span>AltSchool Africa</span> on twitter, <br />
          so i decided to join for the networking community and the
          certification.
        </p>
        <p>
          what i aim to achieve in the school of engineering is to be a good
          developer, good enough to have a stable career with it plus it's a
          skill that will forever be in need so i need to get a piece of the
          pie... ""you know what i mean"."
        </p>

        <p>
          <span
            >my strengths that will help me to succeed in the tech sector
            are:</span
          >
        </p>
        <ul class="ul-li">
          <li>my ability to think of different solutions to a problem</li>
          <li>
            my attitude towards working together as a team without being biased
          </li>
          <li>
            my leadership qualities in bringing everyone together to completing
            a set task
          </li>
          <li>my drive to be successful in all aspects of my life</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          I intend to get a piece of the tech pie and i believe now is the best
          time for me to start, so therefore; <br />
          without further delay here goes my frontend engineering journey at
          AltSchool Africa.

        </p>
        <ul class="ul-li">
          <li>
            "Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every
            time we fall."
          </li>
          <li>"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."</li>
          <li>
            "Defeat is not the worst of failures. Not to have tried is the true
            failure."
          </li>
